Hanni in 2022
On 1 July 2022, ADOR teased the launch of their first girl group, NewJeans, by posting three animated videos of the numbers "22", "7" and "22" on their social media accounts, fueling speculation that content would be released on 22 July. Hanni debuted as a member of the group with the surprise-released single "Attention" on 22 July 2022, without any prior promotion or information regarding the groups lineup. Since debuting, two songs released by NewJeans have featured lyrics written by Hanni: "Hype Boy" and "OMG".

<h4>Labour Committee testimony</h4>
On 15 October 2024, Hanni testified to the Labour Committee of South Korea's National Assembly regarding her experience with Hybe Corporation. The committee considered whether labour rights should be extended to contracted entertainers. Hanni recalled being ostracised by a different group's manager and other experiences of undermining, possibly as a result of strife between senior executives. Hanni and Ador CEO, Ju Young Kim, answered the committee's questions about bullying and dispute resolution. At the hearing, Hanni expressed gratitude for the assistance of the Australian Embassy and was concerned about her Korean language skills. The case was later dismissed by the government agency, with the rationale that K-pop group's members are not classified as workers and are not entitled to labor rights.
